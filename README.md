# Edgar

Edgar is a customizable Node server for running multiple apps in a single Lightsail instance. It uses middleware such a **vhost** so I can serve multiples websites tied to a domain name. It also uses the **compression** middleware to take advantage of gzip compression for maximum webpage serving performance.
